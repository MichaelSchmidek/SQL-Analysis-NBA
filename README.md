# SQL-Data-Analys-Web-Scraped-NBA-Data

# Motivation
This notebook is intended to be educational for those looking to learn the basics of SQL. It involves using SQL to perform data analysis on using a database containing information about the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the process, we will explore the data, utilize joins, perform basic analytics, and create visualizations of relevant trends.

# Process
Our analysis will adhere to the following 4 steps:

1. Gain a high level understanding of the data at hand by looking at and briefly discussing relevant tables in the dataset.
2. Use joins to create new tables for analysis.
3. Perform simple analytics on our data using aggregation.
4. Visualize trends in our data using Plotly and Seaborn.
